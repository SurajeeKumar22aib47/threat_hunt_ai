# Cyber Security System with Generative AI for Threat Detection  

## 1. Introduction  

The **Cyber Security System with Generative AI for Threat Detection** aims to develop a **cutting-edge AI system** for the early detection of **cyber security threats**. Leveraging **generative models** and **machine learning algorithms**, the system accurately identifies **anomalies in network traffic, system logs, and user behavior** that indicate potential security breaches.  

### Key Objectives:  
âœ… **Proactive Threat Mitigation** â€“ Prevent cyber attacks before escalation.  
âœ… **Enhanced Detection Accuracy** â€“ Improve anomaly detection in real-time.  
âœ… **Reduced False Positives** â€“ Ensure precise threat identification.  
âœ… **Faster Incident Response** â€“ Optimize security team reaction times.  
âœ… **Adaptive Security Model** â€“ Evolve with emerging cyber threats.  

### How It Works:  
- Uses **advanced ML models** to analyze **network activity, system logs, and user behavior**.  
- Detects **malware attacks, phishing attempts, and insider threats**.  
- Provides **real-time alerts and insights** for security teams.  
- Seamlessly integrates with **firewall protection** to prevent **data breaches**.  

As cyber threats continue to evolve, many companies are strengthening their **firewall security** to prevent **data leaks**. This AI-driven solution is **fast, efficient, and capable of detecting threats in real time**. The system ensures **high-level data protection** while immediately alerting users of potential risks.  

Letâ€™s explore the **working model** and **detailed descriptions** of the security system.

## 2. Log Retrieving Module  

The **Log Retrieving Module** processes and classifies system logs using libraries like **os, csv, time, and win32evtlog** to enhance **data collection and system monitoring**.  

### Log Classification:  
ðŸ“Œ **Network Logs** â€“ Tracks **network connections, IP traffic, and firewall activity**.  
ðŸ“Œ **Application Logs** â€“ Monitors **installed software (Chrome, antivirus, programs, etc.)**.  
ðŸ“Œ **Performance Logs** â€“ Analyzes **CPU, GPU, memory, and disk performance**.  

### Feature Extraction:  
- **Event IDs**  
- **Source Names**  
- **Input & Output Networks**  

Each **log type** has **different input-output parameters**. Logs are **retrieved every 5 minutes** and passed to the **AI model** for analysis. The **results are displayed to the user** in a **Django-based web dashboard**, allowing individual users to **access system reports via a web portal**.
